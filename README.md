# ASP.NET Core Web API with MediatR, Serilog, Swagger, DDD, CQRS, .NET 8


This repository contains a sample ASP.NET Core Web API project showcasing the integration of various technologies and architectural patterns. The goal is to provide a clean and scalable structure for building modern web applications.

## Technologies and Libraries Used

- **ASP.NET Core:** A cross-platform, high-performance framework for building modern, cloud-based, and internet-connected applications.

- **MediatR:** A simple mediator library for .NET that helps to implement the mediator pattern and simplifies communication between components.

- **Serilog:** A structured logging library for .NET applications, providing powerful log processing capabilities.
  
- **Swagger:** An open-source tool for documenting APIs, allowing developers to visualize and interact with the API resources.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** An approach to software design that prioritizes a deep understanding of the business domain.

- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS):** A pattern that separates the command (write) and query (read) responsibilities of a systemm
